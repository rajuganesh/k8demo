# Example for launching a busybox pod using cstor pool. 
# 
# The cstor pool and storage class used in this example can 
# be setup using YAML present in:
# https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/k8s/sample-pv-yamls/spc-cstor-disk-type.yaml
# 
# Prior to running this YAML, verify that the storage class 
# mentioned below and the corresponding pool is available. 
#
# You can use the below commands to verify.
#
# `kubectl describe sc openebs-cstor-disk`
#
# Note the StoragePoolClaim in the above output. Say it is cstor-disk
# `kubectl describe spc cstor-disk`
